# Study Notes

```
Don't just read it; fight it.

The contents in those notes are written by myself but they are <ins>by no means</ins> my own works. The only reason for me to write those notes is to keep track of my understandings on what I have learned from others. For this reason, the primary goal for the contents in all of my notes here is NOT to deliver knowledge, but to expose weaknesses in my understandings.

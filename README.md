# OpenGL

OpenGL, in itself, is a specification (function declarations) acting as an API to control GPU.

The implementation (function definitions) is in the driver of the controlled GPU (written by the GPU's manufacturer, which means the implementations of OpenGL are most often not open sourced).

OpenGL is cross platform: same OpenGL code can run on multiple platforms.

Shader: a program to run on GPU.
